        <div class="font-grotesq mt-4"> After careful consideration, we regret to inform you that BraveAsk will be discontinued due to financial constraints. Effective immediately, BraveAsk will no longer receive updates or support.

          <br><br>  Since its launch, BraveAsk has been a cherished platform for many, offering unique ways to seek advice, connect with others, and share experiences. We're proud to have facilitated countless meaningful interactions, with users posing over 1000 questions and receiving valuable insights from the community.
            
          <br><br>   Despite our best efforts, sustaining BraveAsk's operations has become increasingly challenging, particularly with the costs associated with server maintenance on Heroku. As a result, we must make the difficult decision to sunset the platform.
            
          <br><br>  We're immensely grateful to each and every one of you who contributed to BraveAsk's journey. Your engagement, feedback, and support have meant the world to us. Thank you for entrusting us with your questions, for sharing your wisdom, and for being part of our community.</div>
